We import the required packages: nltk for natural language processing tasks, pickle for serializing Python objects for shuffling the data.
We download necessary NLTK resources if they haven't been downloaded already.
We initialize the WordNet lemmatizer from NLTK.
We define a sample text dataset (text_data) for demonstration.
We define a function (preprocess_text) to tokenize and lemmatize the text data.
We preprocess the sample text data using the preprocess_text function.
We split the preprocessed data into training and testing datasets.
We shuffle the data to ensure randomness in training and testing.
Finally, we save the preprocessed data and other necessary objects (train_data, test_data, and lemmatizer) . These objects will be used for training and testing the chatbot model.
